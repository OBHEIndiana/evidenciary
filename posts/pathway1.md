# Here is some additional information

It is some sidebar information about stuff to provide extra context. You know the sort. We could presume that it helps you better understand the main content of the page. Perhaps a list of words would help:

* What
* The 
* Heck
* Ya'll

Astute observers of the source code will note that Markdown is easy to compose blog posts in. Maybe this would be easy enough for government work.
